## Hi there! 👋

My name is Qinyi, and I'm in my 5th year of the MInf Informatics programme at the University of Edinburgh.

🔭 I'm currently working on...
- my **MInf Part 2 project** in _training neural networks for self-supervised speech representation learning_, as part of my university coursework
- and also at the same time working remotely part-time as a **research intern** on machine learning methods to effectively utilise and extract the capabilities of _large language models (LLMs) for reasoning_

🌱 I'm currently exploring new domains through courses to broaden my perspectives! At the moment, I'm learning...
- Data Science at Scale
- Biomedical Informatics
- Algorithms and Data Structures
- Causal Inference
- Reinforcement Learning

⚡ My three main hobbies are music, photography, and sports!
- 🎹 I play the piano myself! The latest piece which I'm trying to conquer (and not succeeding very much) is Chopin's first Ballade. Beyond classical music, I enjoy exploring the pop music scene and am always on the lookout for new sounds and genres that catch my ear.
- 📸 I love travelling and capturing the stunning scenery and experiences through photography. Even when I’m not on the road, I enjoy documenting the beautiful moments around Edinburgh - this place never fails to inspire!
- 🏃‍♀️ I've dabbled in a lot of sports growing up, though my late favourites have been table tennis🏓 and snowsports🏂
